1. What is the definition of type? (Hint: there are two parts to the definition)
    Type can be defined as a range of valid values or as a range of valid operations
2. What is the difference between a strongly and weakly typed high-level programming language?
    Strongly typed language - type errors are always detected
    Weakly typed language - type errors are not always detected
3. Why do applications written in a strongly typed high-level programming language usually have fewer bugs than applications written in weakly typed high-level programming languages?
    Applications written in a strongly typed language usually have fewer bugs because they are detected at compile time before they are ran
